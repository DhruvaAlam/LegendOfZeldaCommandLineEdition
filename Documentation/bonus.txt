We implemented the ability to allow users to create their own maps with as many chambers as they would like.
The map should be called defaultfloor.txt and placed in the same folder as the project.
The only requirement is that the top and bottom borders of the map are made with '-' characters and that the left and right borders are made with "|" characters.
We also require that there are at least a total of 42 empty (.) tiles in the map.
The ensure that the game is actually playable, the user should create their own passages between chambers. 
Doing so generates objects randomly.
Alternatively, the user can create any number of floors with the items generated in the map and feed it in the command line.
